# Replace %g %w with any other color you want from the list below
# These are default values. To override these, use the below 'SpecialPlayers' List section for them
sVIPText=%w | %bViP%w
sDonatorText=%w | %g$$$%w
sGodLikeText=%w | %vGoD%w
# Add VIP, Donator or GodLike Players here, follow the exact format | Color is for the Player Name as a whole
# It's best to have only 2 options active at a time, or the scoreboard will act crazy with the fonts and trying to squeeze everything
# If you enable 1 option and the text is huge, try to make the label smaller e.g. 3 letters, like VIP
